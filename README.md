COMP-3340 Final Project
Hello,

Thanks for grading my work!

Here are some resources

The live project can be found here:  http://campb12s.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/60334/project/index.php
The instructor gave me permission to create a quick demo video rather than a report to showcase the main functionalities and provide you with some testing scenarios. The video can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBa90lM56ZA
